      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          The Probability Calculator helps you understand how reliable your team is in battle by analyzing move accuracy and calculating various game probabilities. This tool is essential for making informed decisions about team composition and move
          selection.

          <h3 class="subsection-title">Consistency Score</h3>
          <img class="section-image" src="assets/media/consistency-score.png" alt="Consistency Score interface" />
          <p>The Consistency Score measures how reliable your team is based on the accuracy of each Pokémon's moves. Each Pokémon receives an individual score from 0 to 100, which is then combined into an overall team score.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Main purpose:</strong> The score is designed to be compared between teams - it helps you understand which team is more reliable overall. Higher scores indicate more reliable teams, making it easier to compare different team
            compositions and identify which setup will perform more consistently in battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moves with 100% accuracy contribute positively to the score, while less accurate moves reduce it. If a Pokémon has multiple inaccurate moves, it receives an additional penalty, as the overall moveset becomes less dependable. A single very
            inaccurate move can significantly impact the score, reflecting real gameplay situations where unreliable moves can cost you matches.

          <h3 class="subsection-title">Move Probabilities</h3>
          <img class="section-image" src="assets/media/move-probabilities.png" alt="Move Probabilities interface" />
          <p>For each move in your team, the calculator shows detailed probability tables that help you understand the probability of success across multiple turns. You can see:</p>
          <ul class="subsection-list">
            <li>Hit and miss probabilities for single and multiple targets</li>
            <li>Chances of secondary effects triggering</li>
            <li>How probabilities change over multiple turns</li>
            <li>Differences between single-target and spread moves</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This information is crucial for planning your strategy, as it helps you understand the risks and rewards of using specific moves in different situations.</p>

          <h3 class="subsection-title">Reference Tables</h3>
          <img class="section-image" src="assets/media/reference-tables.png" alt="Reference Tables interface" />
          <p>The calculator also provides general probability tables for common game mechanics, including:</p>
          <ul class="subsection-list">
            <li>Critical hit chances</li>
            <li>Protect success rates</li>
            <li>Sleep duration and wake-up probabilities</li>
            <li>Paralysis, freeze, and confusion effects</li>
            <li>Multi-hit move distributions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These reference tables are useful for strategic planning, helping you make informed decisions about when to use certain moves or abilities, and understanding the statistical probability of various game events occurring.</p>
