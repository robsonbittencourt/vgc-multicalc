  <p>
    The Speed Calc is a precision tool designed to manage the most critical stat in VGC: <strong>Speed</strong>. It allows you to visualize exactly where your Pokémon stands in the initiative order against the entire opposing team and the broader
    competitive meta.

    <p>Turn order can decide the outcome of a match. This tool automatically calculates your Pokémon's effective speed, factoring in items, abilities, and field conditions, and compares it directly with the speed stats of your opponent's Pokémon.</p>

          <strong>Effective Speed:</strong> The calc doesn't just look at base stats; it applies multipliers from abilities (like Swift Swim or Quark Drive), items (like Choice Scarf), and status conditions (like Paralysis) to give you the exact
          number used in-game.

    <p>Customize your comparison list to focus on what matters most for your current match or team building session:</p>

    <ul class="subsection-list">
      <li><strong>By Regulation:</strong> Filter the speed list to only show Pokémon that are legal in the specific VGC Regulation you are playing.</li>
      <li><strong>By Meta:</strong> Focus on the most frequent threats by showing only the top-tier Pokémon currently dominating the competitive scene.</li>
      <li><strong>By Pokémon:</strong> Search for specific Pokémon to see exactly how your active member compares to their speed tiers across different builds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Dynamic Field Modifiers</h3>
    <p>Speed is fluid and changes constantly during a battle. Use the integrated field controls to simulate various scenarios:</p>

    <ul class="subsection-list">
      <li><strong>Tailwind:</strong> Instantly see how doubling your speed (or your opponent's) flips the initiative.</li>
      <li><strong>Trick Room:</strong> Reverses the speed list, highlighting which slow Pokémon will move first under this dimension.</li>
      <li><strong>Icy Wind & Electroweb:</strong> Simulate speed drops to find the exact point where you outspeed a target after a reduction.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Beyond simple comparisons, the insights panel helps you optimize your EV spread:</p>

    <ul class="subsection-list columns-2">
      <li><strong>Outspeed Targets:</strong> Identifies which specific Pokémon you outspeed and which ones you trail.</li>
      <li><strong>Investment Efficiency:</strong> Shows you exactly how many EVs are needed to reach specific speed benchmarks (e.g., "Outspeeding Max Speed Calyrex-S").</li>
      <li><strong>Booster Energy Calc:</strong> Calculates the necessary investment to ensure Speed is your highest stat for Paradox Pokémon abilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Choice Scarf Usage:</strong> Displays the percentage of players using Choice Scarf on specific Pokémon and the resulting speed tier they reach.</li>
