  <p>
    The Type Calc is an essential tool for understanding the tactical relationship between your Pokémon and an opponent's team. It provides a comprehensive breakdown of <strong>Offensive Coverage</strong> and
    <strong>Defensive Vulnerabilities</strong>, helping you identify exactly where your team excels and where it might be exposed.
